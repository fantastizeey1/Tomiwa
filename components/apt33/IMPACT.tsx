          APT33 caused significant operational disruptions and financial losses
          through attacks like the Shamoon incidents in Saudi Arabia. By
          stealing intellectual property from aerospace, energy, and
          petrochemical sectors, APT33 strengthened Iran&#39;s industrial
          capabilities while weakening its victims. The group exploited supply
          chain vulnerabilities, creating ripple effects that impact both direct
          targets and their partners.
